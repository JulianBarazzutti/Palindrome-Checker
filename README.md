A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

If your word or sentence is a palindrome you get the message "{your word or sentence} is a palindrome"

If your word or sentence is not a palindrome you get the message "{your word or sentence} is not a palindrome"
